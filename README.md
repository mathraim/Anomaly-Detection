# Anomaly-Detection
Implemented Anomaly detection from scratch

In this exercise, I implemented an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers

- ex8.m - Octave/MATLAB script for first part of exercise
- ex8data1.mat - First example Dataset for anomaly detection 
- ex8data2.mat - Second example Dataset for anomaly detection
- multivariateGaussian.m - Computes the probability density function for a Gaussian distribution
- visualizeFit.m - 2D plot of a Gaussian distribution and a dataset 
- computeNumericalGradient.m - Numerically compute gradients
- fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc)  
- estimateGaussian.m - Estimate the parameters of a Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix
- selectThreshold.m - Find a threshold for anomaly detection
